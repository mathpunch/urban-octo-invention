## 🚀 Deploy to Vercel (Step by Step)

### 1. Install Dependencies Locally First
You need Node.js 18+ and either npm or pnpm installed.

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 2. Run the Build Script
This copies Scramjet, BareMux, and transport files into /public:

```bash
node build.js
```

You should see:
```
✓ Scramjet files copied to /public/scram/
✓ BareMux files copied to /public/baremux/
✓ Epoxy transport copied to /public/epoxy/
✓ Libcurl transport copied to /public/libcurl/
✓ Build complete!
```

### 3. Test Locally (Optional)
```bash
node server.js
```
Then open http://localhost:8080

### 4. Push to GitHub
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Zyron 2.0 initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zyron-2.0.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 5. Deploy on Vercel
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Click **"Add New Project"**
3. Import your GitHub repo
4. Leave all settings as default (Vercel auto-detects Node.js)
5. Click **Deploy**

> ⚠️ **Important**: Vercel's free plan does NOT support WebSockets natively.
> For full WebSocket/Wisp support you have two options:
>
> **Option A (Recommended):** Deploy to Railway, Render, or a VPS instead — they support WebSockets fully.
>
> **Option B:** Deploy the Wisp server separately (e.g. on Railway) and point the wispUrl in index.html to that external server.
